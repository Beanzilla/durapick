# Dura Pick

Tired of making a lot of pickaxes in minetest?

Need a very good and durable pickaxe?

The answer to both of these good questions is with a Durapick!

Each pickaxe is a bit expensive but worth it, sitting at about 5 times the durability of the standard dull boring default pickaxe.

Collect them all and make a very powerful Dev Pickaxe, unlimited durability mines everything in insane speeds and did I mention it's fast too.
