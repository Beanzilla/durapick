# Dura Pick

Tired of making a lot of pickaxes in minetest?

Need a very good and durable pickaxe?

The answer to both of these good questions is with a Durapick!

Each pickaxe is a bit expensive but worth it.

Just edit the init.lua file's settings area and edit things like durapick_durability_factor to make pickaxes many times stronger than their default counterpicks.

Collect them all and make a very powerful Dev Pickaxe, unlimited durability (or if the setting is true then Dev Pickaxe will have durability) mines everything in insane speeds and did I mention it's fast too. :P
